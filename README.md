# Project-1

## What you achieved
I have completed the html, css and javascript portion.
The structure of the page is how I imagined it.
The wow factor there with the desired property.
I implemented conway's game of life.
It works as I expected. I tested it against well-known pattern and it follows the rules.
I added a start, stop and clean option.
The start option allows the user to begin the animation/rendering once cells has been inputted.
The stop options allows the user to stop and add or remove cells for an extra touch of entropy.
Stop simply pauses the animation and save the state and then can be started once again with start.
Finally, clean does what it says by stopping the animation and cleans the environment.


## What went wrong
The color choice is not the best.
I am planning on going back and choosing a more appropriate color to fit the theme (Pauline).
I will play around with the color, something like black, white and slight gold.
One hing that bothers me is the spacing issues in the footer and navbar.
