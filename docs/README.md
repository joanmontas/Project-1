# Site Purpose
    The purpose of the site is to introduce Pauline.
    The site contains pictures and information about her.

# Site Structure
    The website is composed of three individual sub-pages: index, about, contact and wow.
    Throughout the site you will find the same pattern, navbar, footer left and right section and finally a center section.
    The center section contains information regarding the subpage.
    The right most simply contains a toggle button and aesthetics.
    To aid in accessibility, html tags are present and has been tested to 
    navigate the site (wow factor is an exception as it requires visual and 
    mouse).

# How to Update Site
    In order to update te site, a user would have to replace or add images
    and add additional content; this can be done directly on the ".html" files.
    Colors or certain orientation of tags can be done within
    the "/css/style.css" path.
    Additionally, the "/css/buttons.css" which style button, in this case color and animation when focused.
    Finally, in order to change the wow factor to something with
    more wow-factor, the user would simply have to either keep the
    wow.html's canvas or replace it and then modify the "/js/canvas.js" file.
